If your frontend and backend applications are running in containers on different servers, you would configure NGINX on a separate server to act as a reverse proxy for both containers. Here's an example configuration assuming your frontend container is running on Server A, and your backend container is running on Server B:-


NGINX Configuration on Server A (Frontend):-

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_frontend_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server_b_ip:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        # Additional proxy settings as needed
    }

    # Additional configuration for assets, etc.
}

In this configuration:

Requests to the root path / are proxied to the backend container running on Server B's IP address (backend_server_b_ip) and port 8000.

NGINX Configuration on Server B (Backend):

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_backend_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://frontend_server_a_ip:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        # Additional proxy settings as needed
    }

    # Additional configuration for assets, etc.
}

In this configuration:

Requests to the root path / are proxied to the frontend container running on Server A's IP address (frontend_server_a_ip) and port 3000.

Notes:
Replace your_frontend_domain.com and your_backend_domain.com with your actual domain names.
Replace backend_server_b_ip and frontend_server_a_ip with the actual IP addresses of Server B and Server A, respectively.
Adjust the ports and paths based on your actual setup.
Running the Setup:
Copy the NGINX configurations to the appropriate locations on Server A and Server B.
Test the NGINX configurations: sudo nginx -t.
Restart NGINX on both servers: sudo service nginx restart.
Make sure that both servers are reachable from the internet and that the necessary ports are open. Consider securing your setup with HTTPS, especially if it's a production environment.
